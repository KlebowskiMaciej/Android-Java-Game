# Android/Java Game

The game with the help of which I learned about Android studio. 
It's very simple game inspired by already existing game Doodle Jump, but modified with educational parameter which are platforms with multiplication table, and with character in a red balaclava.

Many elements are missing here and the code itself needs many improvements.
